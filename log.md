# 100 Days Of ML Code - Daily Log

Introduction: me and my junior son @catfield123 are participating this challenge together. 

### Day 0: July 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
- We have decided following topics as top-interesting:
    - One-Shot Learning architectures, MANN.
    - Mixed precision ANN training capabilities
     
- Continued our dive into following papers and presentations:
    - [One-shot Learning with Memory-Augmented Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06065v1)
    - [Neural Turing Machines](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5401.pdf)
    - [Neural networks with external
       memory](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/presentation/3896/fb6dafe8de209cf5f4375ce8c351dcf43c3c.pdf)

**Hours spent:** 1

**Thoughts:** We just started and still looking for real ML task to implement in this challenge. Still studying papers so far.

**TODO:**
- [Mixed Precision Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740)
- [Mixed Precision Training of Convolutional Neural Networks using Integer Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00930)
